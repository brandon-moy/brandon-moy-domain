        Hi I'm Brandon, a Software Developer based in Irvine, CA.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        I used to work in the Hospitality Industry, primarily hotels. I moved up
        in leadership roles in different departments and managed to take away
        many great skills such as communication, leadership, and time management.
        After the loss of two important friends I took a step back to re-evaluate
        my life path and goals.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        I have always had an interest in Software Development and coding, but I
        didn't pursue it at the time because I believed I needed to follow
        the track I was already on after having worked in the Hospitality Industry
        for a few years. I reached out to a close friend from college who is a
        Software Developer and he told me about his role and experience in
        development which made me research more to see if I could still make the
        career change. My friend put me in contact with some of his colleagues
        who had gone through coding bootcamps at a later age and they talked me
        through their bootcamp experience. After these conversation and research
        I decided it was time to take the chance on myself and I enrolled in
        LearningFuze's Full-Immersion Accelerated Web Development program.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        I learned a lot of great skills and technologies during the program such
        as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, React.js (and more!) and since
        my completion of the program I have been working on TypeScript, React Native,
        and CSS challenges and problems.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        I've been loving the change I made for myself into Software Development
        and I'd love to chat about
      </p>
