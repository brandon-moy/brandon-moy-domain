        <p class="about-text">
          Hi I'm Brandon, a Software Developer based in Irvine, CA.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          I used to work in the Hospitality Industry, primarily hotels. I moved up
          in leadership roles in different departments and managed to take away
          many great skills such as communication, leadership, and time management.
          After the loss of two important friends I took a step back to re-evaluate
          my life path and goals.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          I have always had an interest in Software Development and coding, but I
          didn't pursue it at the time because I believed I needed to follow
          the track I was already on after having worked in the Hospitality Industry
          for a few years. I reached out to a close friend from college who is a
          Software Developer and he told me about his role and experience in
          development which made me research more to see if I could still make the
          career change. My friend put me in contact with some of his colleagues
          who had gone through coding bootcamps at a later age and they talked me
          through their bootcamp experience. After these conversation and research
          I decided it was time to take the chance on myself and I enrolled in
          LearningFuze's Full-Immersion Accelerated Web Development program.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          I learned a lot of great skills and technologies during the program such
          as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, React.js (and more!) and since
          my completion of the program I have been working on TypeScript, React Native,
          and CSS challenges and problems.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          I enjoy finding neat CSS tricks or animation and trying to rebuilt them
          myself!
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          I've been loving the change I made for myself into Software Development
          and I'd love to chat!
